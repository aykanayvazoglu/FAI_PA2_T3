To run the Orange workflow, simply open OrangePracticalAssignment2Project.ows file in Orange. 

The File widget is set to retrieve the dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aykanayvazoglu/FAI_PA2_T3/master/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv, so if you will be using it offline, please make sure to point it back to a local copy. (Things may break if this isn't done while both files are available.)
